variables are defined by a letter and a number,
totalling to 260 variables.


"COM0

COM0: Condition
COM1: Statement start

If condition is true, the code inside statement
will be executed, a condition can have AND/OR/NOT,
but cannot stack any of those

LET: Assigns value 1 to value 0
ADD: Adds value 1 to value 0
SUB: Subtracts value 1 from value 0
MUL: Multiplies value 0 by value 1
DIV: Divides value 0 by value 1

PRINT: Outputs value 0
SCAN: Waits for input, which is assigned to value 0
EXIT: Stops program, sending value 0 as code
REM: Remark, a commentary ignored by code

IF/END: Statement that runs once when true
WHILE/LOOP: Statement that runs always when true
GOTO/POS: When GOTO is called, execution goes to POS with same value 0

EQUAL: Returns true if both values are the same
MORE: Returns true if value 0 is bigger than value 1
LESS: Return true if value 0 is smaller than value 1
AND: Placed in between two statements, returns true if both are true
OR: Placed in between two statements, returns true if one is true
NOT: Placed before a statement, returns true if statement is false
